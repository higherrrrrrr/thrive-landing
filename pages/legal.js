            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Representation and Counsel</h2>
            <p>
              Thrive Point Group LLC may, at its sole discretion, be represented by legal counsel or choose to represent itself in various legal matters, including proceedings before courts, arbitrations, and other judicial or quasi-judicial forums. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the LLC is authorized to designate legal representation for its officers in any such proceedings. In instances where legal representation is required or beneficial, designated counsel may act on behalf of both the LLC and its officers. However, where statutory or procedural rules require personal representation, individual officers may be obligated to secure independent counsel or, if necessary, represent themselves. This provision is intended to ensure proper and effective legal representation while complying with all applicable legal mandates.
